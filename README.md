# Orange

This is the user guide for the Orange programming language. Orange is a statically typed, multi-paradigm (imperative, object-oriented, generic) general purpose programming language. It's main goal is to be easy to use and develop both high-level (e.g., web applications) and low-level (e.g., operating systems, embedded development) programs.  

Orange is still a work in progress and is still sees design changes; all features and syntax are subject to change. The branch you are viewing now represents `concept-ver-2`, which is a complete re-imagining of the language and syntax to be more expressive and closer to the C-family of languages.
