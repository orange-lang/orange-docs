# Orange

This is the user guide for the Orange programming language. Orange is a statically typed, imperative, systems programming language. Its main goal is to enable high productivity without sacrificing performance and control. The high productivity is achieved through:

- A package manager
- Support for third-party hooks into the compiler to enable language extensions
- Minimal need for type annotations
- Support for both OOP and structured programming
- Tons of syntatic sugar that make code clear and concise
- Memory safe by default, easy to switch to unsafe
- Builtin complex expressions like array ranges and tuples
- Easily extend existing types, including POD types like int and bool

Orange is still a work in progress and still sees design changes; all features and syntax are subject to change. This branch is `rev-3`, a complete re-imagining of the language and syntax to be more expressive. It takes some ideas from C-family languages and borrows some of the properties of functional programming type systems.
