# Orange

This is the user guide for the Orange programming language. Orange is a statically typed, imperative, object-oriented, and generic systems purpose programming language. Its main goal is to be useful for both high- and low-level development without sacrificing speed or control.

Orange is still a work in progress and is still sees design changes; all features and syntax are subject to change. This branch is `concept-ver-2`, a complete re-imagining of the language and syntax to be more expressive and closer to the C-family of languages.
