# Orange

This is the documentation for the Orange programming language. Orange is a
statically typed, multi-paradigm (imperative, object-oriented, reflective)
systems programming language with focus on high productivity, features for
DRY code, and a smooth syntax without sacrificing efficiency.

Orange is still a work in progress and still under design changes; each
relevant section will be noted with its implementation status. Section will
either be marked as `Design Phase` for things that are still being designed,
`Not Implemented` for things that are designed but not implemented, and
`Implemented` for things that have been implemented into the code.

As Orange is not yet stable, the syntax for any feature, including implemented
ones, can change over time.
